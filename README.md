# Web Art Pages

### Web pages are the coolest canvas ever.

This repository is a collection of my web art experiments—small creative dirty projects, interactive visuals, and unique designs .

I aim to create something daily, even if it’s just a tiny idea.

### using

- HTML + CSS for structure and styling
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Other tools I might explore (WebGL, Three.js, p5.js, etc.)

#### web is art form.
